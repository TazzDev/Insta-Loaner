                <h4>Why Loan against property?</h4><hr style={{width:"50%"}}/><br/>
                <p>Loan Against Property (LAP) or mortgage loan is a type of secured loan offered
                     by banks and Housing Finance Companies (HFCs) against commercial or residential 
                     property owned by the borrower. The amount, which is availed by keeping the 
                     property as collateral till the loan is fully repaid, can be used by the borrower
                      for various purposes like expanding a business, funding childrenâ€™s education, 
                      meeting medical expenses, and more. The maximum loan amount provided under LAP can
                       go up to 70% of the property value. Along with being cost-effective, loans against 
                       property are reasonably convenient to avail and repay due to the relatively low 
                       mortgage interest rate.</p><br/>
                 
                <h4>Features and Benefits of Loan Against Property</h4><br/>

                <p>Availability of higher loan amount and the flexibility to use the amount for various 
                    purposes make LAP a better option compared to a personal loan. Mentioned below are some 
                    of the features and benefits of availing a Loan Against Property.</p>
